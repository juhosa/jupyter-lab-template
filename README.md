# Jupyter Lab template

## Usage

First create a python3 virtualenv

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Then source the newly created env

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

You're good to go. Start JupyterLab with

```
jupyter lab
```

You can use the `starter.ipynb` to create a new notebook with a few import lines already written.
